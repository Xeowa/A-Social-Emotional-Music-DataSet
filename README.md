## Abstract

The Social-Emotional Music (SEM) Dataset represents a novel contribution to music information retrieval research, specifically addressing the intersection of music psychology and social-emotional learning (SEL). This curated collection provides music tracks systematically categorized according to three fundamental emotional competencies: **Outlook**, **Problem-Solving**, and **Empathetic Perspective-Taking**.

Unlike traditional music datasets that focus primarily on genre classification or basic emotional valence, the SEM Dataset bridges the gap between low-level acoustic features and high-level psychological constructs. The dataset was developed through interdisciplinary collaboration between musicologists, psychologists, and educational researchers to support empirical investigation of music's role in social-emotional development and therapeutic applications.

## Dataset Overview

The SEM Dataset provides a standardized resource for researchers investigating the relationship between musical structure and psychological impact, with potential applications in music therapy, educational technology, and affective computing.

| Property | Value        |
|----------|--------------|
| Total Tracks | 419          |
| Total Duration | 3.5 hours    |
| Audio Format | WAV          |
| Sample Rate | 44.1 kHz     |

### Categorical Framework

The three-category framework reflects established constructs in social-emotional learning theory:

| Category | Tracks | Duration   | Theoretical Foundation |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Outlook** | 147    | 1.23 hours | Promotes optimistic cognition through melodic coherence, tonal stability, and harmonic consonance |
| **Problem-Solving** | 138    | 1.15 hours | Enhances analytical thinking through structural complexity, tension-resolution patterns, and cognitive engagement |
| **Empathetic Perspective-Taking** | 134    | 1.12 hours | Facilitates perspective-taking through polyphonic textures, voice leading, and interpersonal musical dialogue |

## Methodological Framework

### Music Selection Criteria

Track selection was guided by established theories in music cognition and educational psychology. Each category represents specific psychological mechanisms:

**Outlook**: Based on research linking melodic fluency and tonal stability to mood enhancement. Selected tracks demonstrate characteristics associated with stress reduction and positive affect, including:
- Predictable melodic patterns that reduce cognitive load
- Consonant harmonic progressions that create emotional stability
- Moderate tempo ranges conducive to relaxation responses

**Problem-Solving**: Grounded in theories of musical expectation and cognitive flexibility. These tracks feature structural elements that mirror problem-solving processes:
- Clear presentation of musical "problems" (tensions, dissonances)
- Logical developmental processes leading to resolution
- Balanced complexity that engages without overwhelming cognitive resources

**Empathetic Perspective-Taking**: Informed by research on musical perspective-taking and social cognition. Selection emphasized:
- Polyphonic textures requiring attention to multiple musical "voices"
- Interactive musical elements suggesting dialogue or conversation
- Emotional narrative arcs that model empathetic responses

## Research Applications

The SEM Dataset supports multiple research paradigms:

### Primary Applications
- **Classification Research**: Automatic categorization of music by social-emotional impact  
- **Music Therapy Studies**: Evidence-based music selection for therapeutic interventions  
- **Educational Technology**: Intelligent music recommendation for social-emotional learning  
- **Cognitive Science**: Investigation of music-emotion relationships
